# Pentest
CompTIA added Pentest+ to the pathway between Security+ and CASP+.  Having completed both CySA+ and Pentest+ before completeing CASP+ I cannot imagine the gap in knowledge that I would have had without Pentest+ and CySA+.  As a corroborating factor, I have met and worked with folks who have Security+ and CASP+ certification only and thre is clear gap in their knowledge between the two courses.  

It is important to note that hackers and ethical hackers use the same tools and methods. So, all Pentest+ learning has to be done through the lens of ethical hacking (persmission recieved and final report/recommendations to be given).  Without that lens, this is just a hacking course and it loses its value.

So, after completing Pentest+ will you be a good hacker?  No.  But you will have the awareness and tools to become one.  
I am a martial artist and instructor and have been asked this question about black belts:  When I have a black belt will I be a great fighter.  No.  But will will have the awareness and tools to become one.  Like a martial arts black belt, a Pentest+ certification is the validation that you have the interest, focus, and skills to get really good.  But the hard work is not done and in the Penetration testing field not only are the goal lines constantly changing, but the field itself is constantly changing.  So, it is absolutely important that you create a lab and practice your skills all the time!  CTFs are a good way to do this too.

Never hack, or even scan a network without written permission!
